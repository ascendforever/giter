# giter
High level iterator wrappers for Python.
Adds intelligent iterators which, for example, can remember their length (when applicable,) and are extensible
Adds objects which behave as standard collections (list, deque, etc.) but are iterators under the hood and lazily load values.
More testing is needed before this can be put into production use.
## Installation
A proper wheel will be created at a later date, for now install by placing this repo in site-packages.
